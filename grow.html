            <p>Growing a garden in Kentucky can be a little challenging when compared to other parts of the United
                States that stay warmer all year round. Kentucky is in Hardiness Zone 6, an area known for mild climates
                with cold winters and humid summers. The state's growing season lasts from early spring to early fall,
                with the winter's last frost occurring in mid-March and the first frost falling in November. Few gardens
                can survive outside that window unless protected in a greenhouse. Take a look below to see some of the
                most popular vegetables that can be grown in Kentucky!</p>

                        <p>Virtually any type of tomato can be grown in Kentucky. There are hundreds of varieties
                            to choose from, whether you plant your own seed or buy plants that have been locally grown.
                            After planting them, amend the soil
                            with bone meal and 10-10-10 fertilizer. In the absence of rain, water them at least twice a
                            week. You'll also
                            need
                            to use some type of support, such as a cage or a stake, or they will eventually get
                            so tall that they will collapse under their own weight. Never leave tomatoes lying on
                            the
                            ground or they are likely to become diseased or be stolen by neighborhood critters. A shifty
                            squirrel will gladly make anything you leave lying around disappear. Most tomatoes are ripe
                            when
                            they
                            are red, but depending on the varitey, they could be orange, yellow, or even purple. Be
                            sure to
                            research your variety so you don't pick it too soon.</p>

                        <p>Peppers are fairly easy to grow. There are not very many pests or animals that eat the
                            leaves or the peppers themselves. Popular varieties are Bell, Jalapeño, Serrano, and
                            Habañero. Your
                            plants will need plenty of sun if you want them to ripen quickly. Peppers grown in shade
                            will ripen very slowly, or sometimes not at all. They come in a variety of colors, but the
                            color
                            typically doesn't have much bearing on the flavor. Depending on personal taste, you can grow
                            peppers
                            that range from sweet all the way to face-melting hot. The hotness of peppers is measured
                            using the
                            Scoville Scale, a numerical system that assigns numbers to peppers
                            to give an indication of how hot they are. It ranges from 0 for bell peppers all the way
                            into
                            the
                            millions
                            for peppers like the Carolina Reaper. Only a crazy person would ever eat one of those!</p>

                        <p>Onion bulbs should be planted about one inch beneath the soil surface. Lightly pack the dirt
                            over top of them, but do not smash it flat or the bulb may have difficulty sprouting and
                            reaching
                            the surface. Like peppers, most animals and pests don't like the taste of onions and tend to
                            leave
                            them alone. They can be harvested at almost any stage. Once the onion sprouts and grows a
                            stalk
                            several inches high, it can be picked as a "green onion" and eaten plain or chopped up for
                            use
                            in meals. As the onions grow larger, they become hotter and more pungent. Once the green
                            stalks
                            wilt
                            and fall over, your onion is as big as it is going to get and is ready to be picked.
                            Depending
                            on the
                            variety, they can grow anywhere from the size of a golf ball to the size of a grapefruit.
                            Onions
                            can
                            tolerate dry conditions, but water them at least twice a week to maximize growth
                            potential.</p>

                        <p>Garlic is one of the simplest plants to grow. There are very few pests that attack it and
                            most
                            animals hate the smell of it and leave it alone. You can plant garlic in the spring for a
                            summer
                            harvest, but for best results, plant it in the last week of October and let it grow all the
                            way
                            until June of the following year. The cold won't kill it and will help make it hardier.
                            Hardneck garlic bulbs will grow scapes, which are green stalks that curl and
                            eventually
                            grow a flower on the end. Once these scapes are about a foot long, you can cut them off and
                            eat
                            them. Removing the scape forces the bulb to stop putting effort into growing a flower and
                            reproducing
                            and makes it put all its effort into bulb growth, nearly doubling the size of the bulb in
                            most cases.
                            Wait about another month after scape removal and your garlic will be ready to pick.</p>

                        <p>Watermelon is not one of the easiest fruits to grow, but it is one of the most delicious.
                            Depending on the variety, watermelons can be anywhere from the size of a bowling ball on up
                            into the hundreds of pounds. In Kentucky, the most popular melons are the Crimson Sweet and
                            the Sugar Baby. Watermelons can be very difficult to grow without using some type of
                            fungicide,
                            such as copper or
                            Mancozeb. Humidity tends to cause downy mildew to appear and kill the plants before they can
                            fully
                            ripen. If you apply fungicide every two weeks during the growing season and provide a lot of
                            water,
                            you will have beautiful melons ready to be picked by the beginning of August. Beware of
                            downy
                            mildew, the main nemesis of the watermelon. This fungus can easily destroy your entire
                            crop.</p>

                        <p>Cucumbers can grow on the ground, but they are for more successful when allowed to climb
                            upward
                            on a
                            trellis, allowing for airflow that will help prevent disease. Pollinators such as bees and
                            ants
                            are
                            crucial to the plants, so be sure to avoid insecticides wherever possible. Most cucumbers
                            are
                            ready
                            to be
                            picked when they are 8 inches long. If you leave them on the vine too long, they will turn
                            yellow.
                            There are certain varieties of cucumbers that have been bred specifically for pickling. These
                            are usually
                            smaller fruits about 4-6 inches long. Cucumber vines can grow upwards of ten feet in length
                            unless you
                            opt for the "Bush" variety, which literally grows into a small bush full of cucumbers.
                            Whichever type
                            you choose, cucumbers are best picked when on the smaller size because they will become
                            bitter as they
                            grow larger.</p>

                        <p>There are dozens of types of squash that can be grown in Kentucky, but the most popular is
                            definitely the zucchini.
                            Zucchini grows quickly and easily when given a high phosphate fertilizer that will help the
                            vegetables develop.
                            It is important to trim back the plant if it becomes too thick, removing overlapping leaves
                            and
                            allowing more
                            airflow between the plants to prevent the appearance of powdery mildew. Zucchini grows as a
                            small
                            bush and will have multiple fruit growing from the stem at one time. Zucchini is at its best
                            when
                            picked when it's about 8-12 inches long. As they grow larger, the skin gets tougher and
                            starts to taste a little bitter. Slice it up and put it on the grill with a little olive
                            oil, salt
                            and pepper for a fantastic summer treat. Watch out for bees that get stuck in the flower blossoms

                        <p>Potatoes should be planted a few inches beneath the soil. As they grow, you will begin to see
                            the soil
                            crack and rise up. It is important to continue to add additional soil at the base of the
                            plants
                            in
                            order to prevent any of the potatoes from breaking through the surface. Eventually, you will
                            end
                            up with a small mound of dirt that could be 8-12 inches in height. If they are exposed to
                            the
                            sunlight, potatoes will begin to turn green and can actually make you sick if you eat them.
                            As the
                            stalks grow above ground, they will eventually develop small flowers. Pinch these flowers off
                            and
                            discard them to make the potatoes put more of their energy into growing the tuber
                            underground
                            instead of trying to reproduce above ground. When potatoes are picked, put them in a box in
                            a cool,
                            dark place. They should last up to 3 weeks. Don't wash them or they will begin to rot much
                            sooner.</p>

                        <p>Asparagus should be planted about 6 inches deep. As the plant begins to grow, you must not
                            harvest it
                            for at least 3 years or you run the risk of killing the plant. Just let it grow and then cut
                            it all
                            down at the end of the year. At the beginning of the third year, you can begin harvesting
                            spears
                            for
                            about 6 weeks. Then let the plant continue to grow. Never harvest all season long or there
                            will
                            be
                            nothing left to grow back the next year. As it grows, the plant essentially turns into a
                            fern and
                            can grow nearly eight feet tall. Some varieties produce berries that attract birds to the
                            area. Unless
                            you plan to use the berries, the birds are harmless. At the end of the year, cut the plant
                            all the way down
                            to the ground to allow it time to overwinter and come back again even stronger the following
                            year.</p>

                        <p>Herbs are abundant in Kentucky. Rosemary, thyme, basil, oregano, sage, mint... they all have
                            wonderful
                            aromas and can add a lot of flavor to any home cooked meal. Nearly all herbs thrive in a
                            nice,
                            sunny spot
                            and need to be watered 2-3 times a week during dry spells. When you trim them, never remove
                            more
                            than 2/3
                            of the plant or you may damage its ability to return the next year. When trimming, you can
                            allow any excess to dry in the sun or you can dry it in a food dehydrator. Virtually any
                            herb
                            can be dried and then crushed into flakes or pulverized into poweder in a food processor.
                            Then you
                            have your very own dried seasonings that are much more flavorful than anything you'd ever
                            buy at the store. Dried herbs will last for years if stored in a cool, dry food pantry.</p>

            <h1>GROW</h1>

            <p>Growing a garden in Kentucky can be a little challenging when compared to other parts of the United
                States that stay warmer all year round. Kentucky is in Hardiness Zone 6, an area known for mild climates
                with cold winters and humid summers. The state's growing season lasts from early spring to early fall,
                with the winter's last frost occurring in mid-March and the first frost falling in November. Few gardens
                can survive outside that window unless protected in a greenhouse. Take a look below to see some of the
                most popular vegetables that can be grown in Kentucky!</p>

                        Virtually any type of tomato can be grown in Kentucky. After planting, amend the soil
                        with bone meal and 10-10-10 fertilizer. Water them at least twice a week. You'll also need
                        to use some type of support, such as a cage or a stake, or they will eventually get
                        so tall that they will collapse under their own weight. Never leave tomatoes lying on the 
                        ground or they are likely to become diseased or be stolen by neighborhood critters.

                        Peppers are fairly easy to grow. There are not very many pests or animals that eat the leaves
                        or the peppers themselves. Popular varieties are Bell, Jalapeno, Serrano, and Habanero. Your
                        plants will need plenty of sun if you want them to ripen quickly. Peppers grown in shade will
                        ripen very slowly, or sometimes not at all.

                        the surface. Like peppers, most animals and pests don't like the taste of onions and tend to
                        leave
                        them alone. Once the green stalks wilt and fall over, your onion is ready to be picked.

                        grow a flower on the end. Once these scapes are about a foot long, you can cut them off an eat

                        Wait about another month after scape removal and your garlic will be ready to pick.

                        Watermelon is very difficult to grow without using some type of fungicide, such as copper or
                        Mancozeb. Humidity tends to cause downy mildew to appear and kill the plants before they can
                        fully
                        ripen. If you apply fungicide every two weeks during the growing season and provide a lot of

                        you will have beautiful melons ready to be picked by the beginning of August.

                        Cucumbers can grow on the ground, but they are for more successful when allowed to climb upward

                        trellis, allowing for airflow that will help prevent disease. Pollinators such as bees and ants
                        are
                        crucial to the plants, so be sure to avoid insecticides wherever possible. Most cucumbers are

                        There are dozens of types of squash that can be grown in Kentucky, but the most popular is
                        probably
                        zucchini.
                        Zucchini gorws quickly and easily when given a high phosphate fertilizer that will help the
                        vegetables develop.
                        It is important to trim back the plant if it becomes to thick, removing overlapping leaves and
                        allowing more
                        airflow between the plants to prevent the appearance of mildew.

                        crack and rise up. It is important to continue to add additional soil at the base of the plants

##The Kentucky Gardener (Code Louisville Web/Dev1 Project)

##The Kentucky Gardener is a website that aims to present information about gardening in the state of Kentucky in several ways:

1.) GROW: Discussing the types of plants and vegetables that can be grown in the area
2.) KNOW: Offering insights and products that will make gardening easier and make your plants more productive
3.) FIGHT: Discussing the most common insects and diseases that can afflict your plants and how they can be managed
4.) EAT: Sharing recipes for meals that can be made from garden grown vegetables and fruits

For this project, I have elected to include the following 4 features:

1.) "Create a responsive menu with Javascript." My menu appears on smartphone and tablet size screens and contains an animation that turns
    the hamburger into an X when clicked and back into a hamburger when clicked again. A transition brings the menu in from the left
    side of the screen when the hamburger is clicked.
2.) "Run an accessibility check and document the adjustments." I ran my check with Lighthouse in Google Chrome. It originally complained
    about my lack of alt tags for my images, as well as load performance on mobile. The complaints appeared geared toward the size of
    my images, which were mostly in the 1-3mb each range when downloaded from Unsplash.com. I used photoshop to drastically reduce the size
    of my entire catalog of images from 43.9mb to 7.8mb. I also added all the necessary alt tags to them. This brought my load and 
    accessibility performance out of the red on subsequent tests.
3.) "Add a transition animation to an element on hover." On my homepage, I have created links that move slightly upward when the mouse
    is hovered over them in preparation for a click.
4.) "Create accordion boxes to display different types of information." My four main sub-pages all have accordion boxes containing
    various types of information. Some of them also include images inside the accordion that chasnge position based on viewport size.

##I have also included the Google font stack "Montserrat" and applied it to the entire website.

##There are no speical requirements to run this webpage.

            <h1>FIGHT</h1>

            <p>In Kentucky, one of the gardener's biggest foes is humidity, especially in the Ohio Valley.
                Humidity is a breeding ground for fungal diseases like powdery mildew, blight, and anthracnose.
                The constant water content in the air during the summer makes these diseases spread even if it
                doesn't rain. The worst insects in the area include beetles, vine borers, squash bugs, and tomato
                hornworms. Many of the most harmful insects and diseases begin showing up in June when the weather
                starts to get significantly warmer. Read on to learn more about some of Kentucky's worst offenders!

                        A cucumber beetle resembles a ladybug in size and appearance, but is easily distinguishable
                        due to its bright yellow color. The adults can be found on cucurbits such as
                        cucumbers, squash, watermelon, and a variety of other plants. They are notorious pests of
                        agricultural crops.
                        The insects live for about eight weeks, during which time both they feed on plants.
                        Adults will attack the tender young growth of stems and leaves and the buds and petals on
                        mature specimens. They also carry and spread bacterial wilt, a disease that can kill entire
                        plants in a matter of weeks.
                        Eradication efforts include clearing cultivated areas of litter, debris, and infested
                        plants. They are also attracted to the color yellow, so placing yellow sticky traps in the area
                        will often capture hundreds of them and take them out of circulation in your garden.

                        The squash bug is a major pest of squash and pumpkins and is found throughout North America.
                        They
                        emit an unpleasant odor when killed.
                        The adult female lays two or three batches of about eighteen eggs, oval and bronze in colour,
                        and are deposited on the underside of the leaves of the host plant. The eggs hatch after seven
                        to
                        nine days into nymphs and immediatley begin feeding on the plant where they emerged. They
                        physically damage
                        the xylem and leaves of the plant, which causes them to wilt, darken in colour and die. The
                        heavier
                        the infestation, the greater the damage to the plant. They are large bugs and can often be
                        manually removed
                        and dropped into a bucket of soapy water and left to drown. If not controlled, they will
                        multiply
                        by the hundreds and completely decimate entire crops of vegetables.

                        The squash vine borer is a species of moth that is often mistaken for a bee or wasp because of
                        its movements, and its bright orange hind leg
                        scales. The females typically lay their eggs at the base of leaf stalks, and the caterpillars
                        develop and feed inside the stalk, eventually killing the leaf. They soon migrate to the main
                        stem, and with enough feeding damage to the stem, the entire plant may die. It attacks
                        cultivated
                        varieties of squash, zucchini, pumpkin, and acorn
                        squash. The squash vine borer is native to North America, with some reports as far south as
                        Brazil and Argentina. It lives in most temperate US states, except the Pacific
                        coast. Southern states have two broods a year. A small utility knife and tweezers, or other fine
                        tools, may be used to gently cut open the stem
                        and try to extract the larva before it can kill the plant.

                        The tomato hornworm is a major pest in gardens; they get their name from a dark projection on
                        their posterior and their use of
                        tomatoes as host plants. Tomato hornworms are closely related to (and sometimes confused with)
                        the tobacco hornworm Manduca Sexta. This confusion arises because caterpillars of both species
                        have similar morphologies and feed on the foliage of various plants in the tomato and tobacco
                        families.
                        Because of this, the plant on which
                        the caterpillar is found does not indicate its species. They commonly feed on
                        tomato, eggplant, pepper, tobacco, moonflowers and potato. Caterpillars can often be found on
                        plants
                        during the day and are generally high up in the leaves. They are very large insects, often over
                        1 inch
                        in length, and can be manually
                        removed from plants with ease and disposed of.

                        The Japanese beetle is a species of scarab beetle. The adult has an iridescent copper-colored
                        body and a green
                        thorax and head. It is not very destructive in Japan (where it is controlled by natural
                        predators), but in North America and some regions of Europe it is a noted pest to roughly 300
                        species of plants, including rose bushes, grapes, hops, canna, crape myrtles, birch trees,
                        linden trees, and others. The adult beetles damage plants by skeletonizing the foliage
                        (consuming
                        only the material
                        between a leaf's veins) as well as feeding on a plant's fruit. The subterranean
                        larvae feed on the roots of grasses. Owing to its destructive nature, traps have been invented
                        specifically to target Japanese beetles. These comprise a pair of crossed walls with a bag or
                        plastic container underneath and are baited with floral scent, pheromone, or both. The bugs
                        crawl
                        inside, get trapped and die.

                        Fusarium wilt is a common vascular wilt fungal disease.
                        The fungal pathogen Fusarium Oxysporum affects a wide variety of plants of any age. Tomato,
                        tobacco, legumes, cucurbits, sweet potatoes and banana are a few of the most susceptible plants,
                        but it also infects other herbaceous plants. The fungus generally produces symptoms such as
                        wilting, chlorosis, necrosis, premature leaf drop, browning of the vascular system, stunting and
                        damping-off. It starts out looking
                        like vein clearing on the younger leaves and drooping of the older lower leaves, followed by
                        stunting, yellowing of the lower leaves, defoliation, and plant death. Once
                        the
                        fungus has appeared, it is generally too late to save the plant. Preventative steps should be
                        taken
                        to prevent its appearance, such as the application of natural fungicides like Copper and
                        Mancozeb.

                        Blight is a rapid and complete chlorosis, browning, then death of plant tissues such as leaves,
                        branches, twigs, flowers, or fruit.
                        When blights have been particularly vast and consequential in their effects, they have become
                        named historical events, such as the 19th Century Potato Blight, also known as the Great Famine
                        of Ireland. Also notable is the near extinction of the
                        Bermuda cedar during the 1940s and 1950s in the event
                        described as The Cedar Blight. In tomatoes, blight often appears from the lower leaves of the
                        plant and works its way upward, first manifesting as yellowing leaves and then appearing as
                        black
                        spots on the stems and leaves and eventually on the fruit itself. There is no cure for blight;
                        any
                        plant beleived to be suffering from the disease should be removed from the garden and destroyed
                        as
                        quickly as possible.

                        Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that affects a wide range of plants. The disease is caused
                        by many different species of fungi and is one of the easier plant diseases to identify, as its
                        symptoms are quite distinctive.
                        Infected plants display white powdery spots on the leaves and stems. The lower leaves are the
                        most affected, but the mildew can appear on any above-ground part of the plant. As the disease
                        progresses, the spots get denser as large numbers of spores are formed, and
                        the mildew may spread up and down the length of the entire plant.
                        Powdery mildew grows well in environments with high humidity and moderate temperatures, such as
                        Kentucky. The disease is also known to cause harm to agricultural and horticultural practices in
                        a greenhouse setting. Preventative maintenance is the key: apply natural fungicides
                        such as Copper and Mancozeb before the disease makes an appearance.

                        agriculture, they are a particular problem for growers of grapes and any vegetables that
                        grow on vines. Yield loss associated with downy mildew is usually
                        related to soft rots that occur after plant canopies collapse and sunburn occurs on fruit.
                        Initial symptoms include large, angular or blocky, yellow areas visible on the upper surface
                        that expand rapidly and turn brown. In
                        disease-favorable conditions (cool nights with long dew periods), downy mildew will spread
                        rapidly, destroying all leaf tissue.
                        One way to control the spread is to eliminate moisture and humidity around the impacted
                        plants. You can achieve this by watering from below, such as with a drip system, and improving
                        air circulation through selective pruning.

                        A leaf spot is a discolored, diseased area of a leaf that is caused by fungal,
                        bacterial or viral plant diseases. These discoloured spots or lesions often have a center of
                        necrosis (cell death).
                        Prolonged wet and humid conditions promote leaf spot disease and most pathogens are spread by
                        wind, splashing rain or irrigation that carry the disease to other leaves.
                        Spots can vary in size, shapes and colors depending
                        on the age and type of the cause or pathogen. Plants, shrubs and trees are weakened by the spots
                        on the leaves as they reduce the ability to complete photosynthesis.
                        Fungicides such as Zineb, Chlorothalonil and Captan, can be used to treat the disease. If
                        the spots appear later in the season, they can usually be ignored if present on deciduous plants
                        since the leaves will be dropped. Be sure to bag the leaves and remove them to prevent the
                        disease from reappearing the following year.
